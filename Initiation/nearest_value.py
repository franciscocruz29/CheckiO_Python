""" Find the nearest value to the given one. You are given a list of values as set form and a value for which you need to find the nearest one.

A few clarifications:

  If 2 numbers are at the same distance, you need to choose the smallest one;
  The set of numbers is always non-empty, i.e. the size is >=1;
  The given value can be in this set, which means that itâ€™s the answer;
  The set can contain both positive and negative numbers, but they are always integers;
  The set isnâ€™t sorted and consists of unique numbers.

Input: Two arguments. A list of values in the set form. The sought value is an int.

Output: Int. """
